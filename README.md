## 🚀 Elevator Pitch

Sats Pocket is a visually stunning, intuitive Bitcoin micro-wallet designed for seamless peer-to-peer transactions, bill-splitting, and personal finance tracking — all wrapped in a neon cyberpunk UI. It’s not just a wallet — it’s a glimpse into the future of digital finance.

## 💡 Inspiration

Despite Bitcoin’s technical advancement, most wallets still feel sterile, complex, and uninviting. We wanted to challenge that by asking:

> *What if using a Bitcoin wallet felt as magical as exploring a sci-fi world?*

Inspired by cyberpunk design principles and usability-first thinking, Sats Pocket blends functionality with emotional design, giving users a delightful, accessible experience in crypto management.
